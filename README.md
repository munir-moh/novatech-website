## 🐛 Known Issues / Bugs

> **Instructions:** Be honest about any bugs or issues you're aware of. This shows maturity and self-awareness — real developers always track known issues.

| # | Issue | Page | Severity | Description |
| - | ----- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1 | [e.g., "Hero image loads slowly on mobile"] | [e.g., index.html] | [Low/Medium/High] | [Brief description of the issue and any workaround] |
| 2 | [Issue title] | [Page] | [Severity] | [Description] |
| 3 | [Issue title] | [Page] | [Severity] | [Description] |

> If you have **no known issues**, write: "No known bugs at the time of submission. Tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari."

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

> **Instructions:** If you had more time, what would you add or change? List at least 3 improvements.

1. **[Improvement 1]** — [e.g., "Add page transition animations between pages using CSS keyframes"]
2. **[Improvement 2]** — [e.g., "Implement a working contact form backend using Formspree or EmailJS"]
3. **[Improvement 3]** — [e.g., "Add a blog page with article cards and a reading view"]
4. **[Improvement 4]** — [e.g., "Implement lazy loading for portfolio images to improve performance"]
5. **[Improvement 5]** — [e.g., "Add ARIA landmarks and improve keyboard navigation for accessibility"]

---

## 🎨 Design Decisions

> **Instructions:** Briefly explain any design choices you made that differ from or extend the provided design system.

- **[Decision 1]:** [e.g., "I chose the accordion interaction for the services page because it keeps all content on one page and reduces scrolling."]
- **[Decision 2]:** [e.g., "I added a subtle hover animation on team cards to make the page feel more interactive."]
- **[Decision 3]:** [e.g., "I used a pure CSS gradient for the hero instead of an image to improve load time."]
